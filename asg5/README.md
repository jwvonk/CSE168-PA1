Animated Object: Spirit floating above the cat, cat's tail  
Textured Primary shapes: grass, stairs, ground plane  
Custom textured 3D mode: gazebo, street lamps  
Light Sources: Ambient Light, Directional Light, Point Light (from lamps and spirit)  
Primary shapes: Pretty sure the fences are enough for 20 shapes, but there's also the cat made with cylinders, cones, and octahedrons, and the spirit is made from sphere.  
Extra: Shadow added, Fog added, and Lensflare is the extra technique I found on three.js tutorials (the assignment explicitly mentioned that you can find other techniques you are interested in learning).
